## Introduction
This dataset provides a comprehensive look at the modern Olympic Games, spanning from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. It includes detailed information about the events, athletes, and countries participating in each edition of the Games. The data was scraped from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018.

The data was scraped using R code, which is available in the repository under scraping_code/R_scraping_script.R. The scraping process involved gathering information from the website and wrangling it into a structured format suitable for analysis.

#### Important Note
It's essential to note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year until 1992. After 1992, they were staggered, with the Winter Games occurring on a four-year cycle starting in 1994, followed by the Summer Games in 1996, and so on. This distinction is crucial for accurate analysis of the data.
